### Team Name: Hackbots


### Team Members

### Project Description
Taking texting beyond the boundaries of impairments.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you send text messages to a blind person?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Here is a way to communicate with blind and deaf people. A keyboard that converts text messages to Braille code in real time (it has different modes!!!). Also it has a mode that converts text into morse code similarly, WITH audio(NOT your regular pings and beeps ;))..Braille for your blind friend and Morse for your deaf one. Now you can include them in the groupchat <3
